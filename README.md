# LeetCode-SQLSolutions

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Eden and I am employed as a Database Associate. I created this repository to showcase my SQL skills on LeetCode problems in both MySQL and SQL Server. I complete the SQL problems within LeetCode and document those solutions in SQL Server. It is advantageous for me to complete these solutions in both query languages as it allows me to learn both concurrently. This repository is primarily used for learning more SQL through a hands-on approach. 

I consider myself to be quite analytical and detail-oriented. When Iâ€™m learning something new, I often find myself focusing on the finer details and asking questions that others might not have considered. I sometimes discuss these topics with peers and colleagues, and they occasionally mention that they hadnâ€™t thought about how certain details could impact the subject. I also like to explore the underlying purpose of the topics Iâ€™m studying.

## Known Issues
For a couple of the SQL Files, I did not write the code for the tables, so if you run those files the query will not work, however, this is something that I am in the process of fixing. The files that do not have tables are: 
1. 1148ArticleViewsI.sql
2. 577EmployeeBonus.sql
3. testQuery.sql 


## Expectations


As this is a learning environment, I am open to any suggestions or feedback I can use to create my tables or queries more efficiently. Let me know if there is anything I can do or improve and I will be grateful for the advice! You can provide advice or feedback by commenting on a specific SQL file that your advice applies.
