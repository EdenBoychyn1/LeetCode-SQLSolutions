# LeetCode-SQLSolutions

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹ My name is Eden and I am employed as a Database Associate. The reason why I created this repository is to showcase my SQL skills on LeetCode problems in both MySQL and SQL Server. I complete the SQL problems within LeetCode and document those solutions in SQL Server. It is advantageous for me to complete these solutions in both query languages as it allows me to learn both concurrently. This repository is primarily used for learning more SQL through a hands-on approach.
